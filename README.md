# Installation

1. Used React Router and Bootstrap to implement a navigation component.
2. Used Axios for API calls to handle GET, POST, PUT and DELETE calls.
3. Used Redux with repository actions and reducers.
4. Implemented a lazy loading Higher Order Component (HOC) to load components asynchronously.
5. Centralized error handling using the Redux workflow.
6. Created reusable modal window components using Bootstrap.
7. Created a configuration object to dynamically generate our forms.

Server-side code is in my AccountOwnerServer repository.
